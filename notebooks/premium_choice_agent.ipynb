    "# 🤖 Hybrid Multi-Agent System Showcase\n",
    "\n",
    "**Author:** Juan Jose Pardo\n",
    "**Project:** A comprehensive demonstration for Wholesale proyect Premium Choice using AI reference technologies: Multi-Agent Systems, Langchain, LlamaIndex, RAG, and Agent Frameworks (MCP).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "This notebook builds a sophisticated multi-agent system that handles both **structured data** (Excel sales files) and **unstructured data** (text-based incident reports).\n",
    "\n",
    "This architecture directly demonstrates the required skills:\n",
    "- **Langchain:** Used for the main orchestrator agent and the structured data tool.\n",
    "- **LlamaIndex:** Used to build a classic RAG pipeline for unstructured Q&A.\n",
    "- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** Implemented via LlamaIndex for querying text documents.\n",
    "- **Multi-Agent System & MCP (Multi-Agent Coordination Protocol):** The core design features a primary agent that routes tasks to specialized sub-agents, acting as a coordination protocol."
