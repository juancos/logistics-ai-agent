Business Strategy Report - 2022 Review

The significant growth experienced starting in mid-2022 is directly attributable to two key initiatives. 
First, in May 2022, Premium Choice secured an exclusive distribution agreement with 'ST DALF', a popular French gourmet food brand. 
This allowed us to corner the market on their highly sought-after jams.

Second, in June 2022, we launched a targeted B2B sales campaign aimed at major supermarket chains, 
offering them preferential pricing. This strategy successfully brought on board key accounts, including Cencosud and Almacenes Ã‰xito, 
which became major purchasers of the new product lines.
